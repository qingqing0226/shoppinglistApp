## About The Project

This is my personal project in Java Fullstack Bootcamp at [<\/salt>](https://www.salt.dev/)

My idea was to build a shopping list application, which follows the mobile first strategy. 

Unlike the notes tools you may had used before, this app allows the users to estimate how much they are gonna spend for one shopping 
and also keep tract of how much they have spent in the past week/month/year. 
In addition to that, the users will be able to recycle their old shopping list and make new list based on it. 
That will be convenient for those who buy pretty much the same goods every week.

The UI of the app consists of three "pages" or views.
<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Create List</li>
  <li>View All</li>
</ul>

On the landing page - **Home**, you will see the details of the latest shopping list that is not completed yet.<br />
On the next page - **Create List**, you can create a new shopping list. You'll be able to add the price and amount of items. 
The total price will be automatically calculated at the same time.  
On the third page - **View All**, you can check the shopping history.
